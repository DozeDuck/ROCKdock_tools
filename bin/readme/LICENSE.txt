2.8 NLopt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NLopt library is under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the
copyrights are owned by a variety of authors.

In general, the different code in NLopt comes from different sources, and have a variety
of licenses. For example, all of the new code we wrote for NLopt is under the MIT License
(which imposes essentially no practical restrictions, and is hence compatible with the
LGPL). The combination of all of this software is under the conjunction of the license
terms, and in particular they are limited by the most restrictive of the licenses for the
portions, which in this case is the LGPL. (The other portions of NLopt are under
LGPL-compatible, less-restrictive licenses like the MIT license. So, if you remove the
LGPL portions, which are currently code by Ladislav Luksan, the remainder reverts to a
looser license.)

New code written by me for NLopt is Copyright (C) 2007-2010 Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and comes with no warranty:

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE
FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

Please cite NLopt and the authors of the respective algorithms in any publication for
which you find it useful. (This is not a legal requirement, just a polite request.)

You can find a copy of the LGPL at  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ and in
license_LGPLV3_GPLV3 file. NLopt is linked with a shared library mechanism. Installation
information is provided in the Installation_SRC_NLopt.txt file.
