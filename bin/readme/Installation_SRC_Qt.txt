Qt library
==========

Replacing the Qt library without modification is possible, but may cause problems with the
png library, because it is statically linked into the application (using libpng v1.6.37).
To replace the Qt library copy your version in the following directories:

Windows:
- <INSTALL_DIR>
- <INSTALL_DIR>/plugins
- <INSTALL_DIR>/qml

Linux:
- <INSTALL_DIR>/lib
- <INSTALL_DIR>/plugins
- <INSTALL_DIR>/qml

macOS:
- <APP_DIR>/Contents/Frameworks
- <APP_DIR>/Contents/PlugIns
- <APP_DIR>/Contents/qml

The Qt source code can be obtained from:
